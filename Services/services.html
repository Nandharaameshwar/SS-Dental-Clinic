                    Having a gap in your teeth makes you less inclined to smile and makes you feel less confident in your appearance. 
                    Having a bridge or crown will revive that confidence and you’ll feel happier knowing that your teeth look great. 
                    Porcelain will match the natural colour of your teeth and nobody will even know you’ve had cosmetic treatment done.
                    With the correct routine of oral hygiene and if you keep your mouth clean, crowns and bridges can last up to 15 years or even longer. 
                    It’s important to continue with regular check ups to make sure there are no issues, but, if taken care of properly, they will last a very long time.

                        The extraction of the mandibular third molar is the most frequent intervention in oral surgery and 
                        it is sometimes associated with less or more severe complications. Among these, the most dangerous is the damage to the inferior alveolar nerve.
                        In the last decades, thanks to the improved expertise in identifying risky cases and the refinement of surgical techniques, the prevalence of complications has been progressively reduced.
                        The present paper describes a rational approach to the surgical extraction of the mandibular third molar, in order to limit surgical complications.

                        Teeth scaling and root planing help to treat chronic periodontal disease (otherwise known as gum disease). They are more in-depth than a typical teeth cleaning.
    
                        Teeth scaling and root planing often take more than one dental visit and could require a local anesthetic based on the severity of your chronic periodontal disease and 
                        if you have receding gums.
    
                        Recovery from this outpatient procedure usually only takes a few days but may take longer.

                <p>Your dentist will recommend teeth scaling and root planing if your mouth has signs of chronic periodontal disease. 
                    These procedures can help stop the harmful effects of this condition and keep your mouth healthy.

                    Chronic periodontal disease occurs when the bacteria in plaque cause your gums to pull away from your teeth. 
                    This causes large pockets to grow between your teeth and gums, and more bacteria can grow there that you cannot reach with teeth brushing at home.

                            Fresh breath. Persistent bad breath (known as halitosis), is a key indicator of gum disease, and is caused by the build-up of rotting food particles below the gum line, bacteria and plaque.

                        <li>Identification of other health problems. The oral cavity can actually tell your dentist a lot about your overall health and regular periodontal appointments will allow your dentist to do 
                            thorough examinations of your mouth, meaning that any potential problems can be picked up on really quickly.</li>
